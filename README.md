I'm a research software engineer for the [tilt](https://www.tiltsmes.org/)
project of [Theia Finance Labs](https://theiafinance.org), and an editor for [rOpenSci's software
peer-review program](https://ropensci.org/software-review/).

Before I have:

* Worked remotely for [2Â° Investing Initiative
(Germany)](https://2degrees-investing.org/) where I built "r2dii": A collection
of R packages for banks to analyze climate scenarios
([website](https://pacta.rmi.org/pacta-for-banks-2020/),
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html#available-packages-R)).

* Worked at the Smithsonian [National Museum of Natural History
(USA)](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/) for
[ForestGEO](https://www.forestgeo.si.edu/), where I built "fgeo": A collection
of R packages to analyze forest diversity and dynamics
([website](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/),
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fgeo/index.html)).

* [Researched marine biology](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mauro-Lepore)
as a post-doc at [The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
(Panama)](https://stri.si.edu/es), as a PhD student at [The University of
Queensland (Australia)](https://www.uq.edu.au/), and as a graduate student at
