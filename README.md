I’m a research software engineer with over 10 years of experience working with the full stack around R. I began as a researcher and transitioned to software development.

I started using the R stack during the early stages of my PhD, and used it everywhere in my thesis from data-wrangling to advanced statistics and plots. By the time I was a postdoc, I was not only using the R ecosystem but also helping others to do the same.

I realized that I was passionate about reproducible and open science, and that I could not only advocate for it, but also I could "engineer" reproducibility and openness directly into the systems that researchers use. I left academia and worked at the Smithsonian Institution to transform a valuable but messy collection of R scripts into "fgeo," a "universe" of five R packages that I published and still maintain on CRAN.

To spread the love more widely, I joined The Carpentries as a data-science instructor and rOpenSci as an associate editor of peer-review software and mentor for open source/science champions. 

Around the same time I also joined Theia Finance Labs to replicate the modernization project I had done before. Here I created "r2dii," my second "universe" of four R packages which I published on CRAN and later delegated to co-authors. Then I transitioned internally to the project "tilt," my third "universe" of R packages and the first to have an interactive front-end built with R shiny.

Over the years, I’ve mastered a range of free and open-source tools, including Linux, Docker, Git, R, and GitHub, and have tackled tasks spanning the entire data-science workflow such as estimating effort, managing project boards, gathering, wrangling, and analyzing data, testing software, setting up CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure, writing computational reports, building interactive applications, teaching, and more.

I regularly contribute to community projects to learn and share knowledge, such as my own data-science incubator on YouTube, the ixpantia masterclass, eLife Innovation Leaders, multiple R packages on CRAN, and the rOpenSci Champions program.

From universities to think tanks I've helped bridge the gap between science and technology, amplifying the impact of research with tools, practices, and strategies borrowed from both worlds. To maximize that impact I then joined ixpantia, to design and execute Research Software Engineering as a service.
