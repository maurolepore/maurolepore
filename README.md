### JOB

I'm a research software engineer working remotely for the
['tilt'](https://www.tiltsmes.org/) project of [Theia Finance
Labs](https://theiafinance.org). 

Responsabilities:

* Communication: Translating research ideas to reproducible examples and testable
requirements.
* Back-end development: Implementing valuable tools as quickly and cheaply as possible.
* Front-end development: Designing intuitive user-interfaces to empower users.
* DevOps: Building workflows to continuously integrate and deliver the system
(CI/CD).
* Technical Writing: Writing documentation that is clear, correct, complete and
maintainable.
* Software architecture: Evolving the system's architecture as necessary to allow growth.
* Mentoring: Empowering other developers to do all of these themselves.

### EXPERIENCE

* I worked remotely for [2Â° Investing Initiative
(Germany)](https://2degrees-investing.org/) where I built 'r2dii': A collection
of R packages for banks to analyze climate scenarios
([website](https://pacta.rmi.org/pacta-for-banks-2020/),
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html#available-packages-R)).

* I worked at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (USA) for
[ForestGEO](https://www.forestgeo.si.edu/), where I built 'fgeo': A collection
of R packages to analyze forest diversity and dynamics
([website](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/),
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fgeo/index.html)).

### ACADEMIC
